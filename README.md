# KYCS
Know Your CodeForces Submissions.

## Introduction
I have created certain [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/) submission visualization some days back (can be found [here](https://github.com/JeetKaria06/CF_Submissions/tree/master/Submission_Visualization)). And getting a really positive response, I thought of combining all of them at one place and make them easy to use which obviously needs deploying to web and needs nothing more than a good internet. So, I have come up with this small [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) python app which allows us to create really nice data analytics app and the main thing is its OpenSource.

## How to Use?
Just follow the instructions written in the top left corner of the [page](https://kycs.herokuapp.com/) when the app gets lauched from the web. 

The instructions look something like this:

It's damn easy, don't you feel the same? Now go on and explore ;)

And also bootstrapped the buttons' icons and making them look more pleasant than before.

## Version 3
<h3>Average Submissions with date on the x-axis</h3>

One might want to analyze his/her own average number of submissions made per day in any given range of dates as shown below :

![Output4](https://github.com/JeetKaria06/KYCS/blob/master/Images/sd1.png)

And can see the average submissions by hovering the mouse over the graph as shown :

![Output5](https://github.com/JeetKaria06/KYCS/blob/master/Images/sd2.png)

If one wants to see his/her only ```OK``` submissions then keep that checkbox selected and deselect the others will give you your desired graph.

<h3>Submissions Bifurcated based on Problem's Indices </h3>

Number of submissions of particular index with particular verdict and even the rate of submitting the particular verdict submission of some index, all in one. Below is shown how :
