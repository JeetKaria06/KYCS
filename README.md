# KYCS
Know Your CodeForces Submissions.

## Introduction
I have created certain [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/) submission visualization some days back (can be found [here](https://github.com/JeetKaria06/CF_Submissions/tree/master/Submission_Visualization)). And getting a really positive response, I thought of combining all of them at one place and make them easy to use which obviously needs deploying to web and needs nothing more than a good internet. So, I have come up with this small [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) python app which allows us to create really nice data analytics app and the main thing is its OpenSource.

## How to Use?
Just follow the instructions written in the top left corner of the [page](https://kycs.herokuapp.com/) when the app gets lauched from the web. 

The instructions look something like this:

Added loading state animation and making it more user-friendly.

And also bootstrapped the buttons' icons and making them look more pleasant than before.
